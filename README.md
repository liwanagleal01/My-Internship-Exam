# My-Internship-Exam
This is my internship exam.

The app saves the last screen it was on before you exit the app. Then when you open the app again you'll come back to the last screen before exiting.

I used linear layout for this project, so i won't have much of the problem with the different screen size of devices.

I have applied Structural Pattern in form of Adapter.

I've included comments on the code for other information.
